    <p>Sploder, a user's guide
      <br>
      <br>
      During my first year at University I created a website using WordPress.
      The website was centred around how to use a website called Sploder. 
      Sploder is a website which allows users to create their own games within the website itself. 
      I was in charge of creating the website and amending the various sections of the site when needed. 
      Each member of the group were given their own section within the site to work on. 
      I was in charge of writing the “Sploder’s use in education” section. 
      Throughout the project I was given the role of ensuring all sections of the site were free from 
      spelling mistakes and that the content of the page was correct. The site is still functioning to this day and 
      can be viewed here.

    <h1>LImBuS Biobank Information Management System</h1>
    <p>During July-August 2021 I had the opportunity to work on LImBuS Biobank Information Management System. 
      I worked on various parts of the website while working there. The main structure of the website is built
      off of a Python framework called Flask. Before working on the system, I had never used Flask before. 
      While reading through the code I picked up an understanding on the code. I worked using a variety of 
      languages while there. These included Python, JavaScript, HTML and some SQL. 
      <br>
      <br>
      For the first few weeks I was mostly working on improving the interface. This included changing what
      information was displayed on the site. This required changing code in a JavaScript file and some HTML.
      I then moved on something slightly more complicated which was changing how a table was displayed. This
      required me to have some knowledge of a variety of languages e.g. Python, JavaScript, HTML and SQL. This
      was difficult as the system is fairly large and complex and it required work on both the front-end and the
      back-end of the site. It also included connecting various parts of the site to each other through Python files.
      I needed to display the shelf that was associated to the rack and also include a link to the shelf itself.
      <br>
      <br>
      For the final week it was discussed with a colleague that if a user were to sign-up to the site, that they
      should be sent a confirmation email when they signed-up to the site. This was challenging as it required
      a flask-extension to be installed which was Flask-Mail. This required installing the extension using a terminal.
      I wasn't too familar using a terminal to manage files therefore it was a bit challenging. I managed to get the
      extension to install with the assistance of a colleague which I was happy with. Once the extension was installed
      I continued working on implementing the extension for the remainder of the week while I was there.</p>
