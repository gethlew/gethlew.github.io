    <p>Sploder, a user's guide
      <br>
      <br>
      During my first year at University I created a website using WordPress.
      The website was centred around how to use a website called Sploder. 
      Sploder is a website which allows users to create their own games within the website itself. 
      I was in charge of creating the website and amending the various sections of the site when needed. 
      Each member of the group were given their own section within the site to work on. 
      I was in charge of writing the “Sploder’s use in education” section. 
      Throughout the project I was given the role of ensuring all sections of the site were free from 
      spelling mistakes and that the content of the page was correct. The site is still functioning to this day and 
      can be viewed here.

    <h1>Welsh game for children</h1>
  <p>
    For my final year project during university, I was given the task to create a website for a client. 
    Although I didn’t have a specific client, I had a family member who works at a school and they noticed that the children were starting to use their iPad/tablets more for reading and learning. 
    As welsh is one of my first languages, I decided to create a website which could help young children learn welsh. 
    I wanted my website to include bright colours and pictures to draw the user’s attention and to make the experience playful and fun for the user.
  </p>

  <h2>How to play a level</h2>
  <p>
    All three of the games playable on the site currently function the same. 
    The user is given a question in Welsh and they have to pic the correct corresponding image/word to gain points.

  </p>

  <h3>Home screen</h3>
  <p>
    The home screen works also works as a help page. 
    It includes a screenshot of each of the three games playable on the site along with a short paragraph describing how the games work. 
    Using an on-screen button, it is possible to change the language used from English to Welsh or vice versa.

  </p>

  <h4>Problems faced and solutions given</h4>
  <p>
    My original plan was to give the user the ability to save and view their score that they got for the games. 
    I would have done this by building a form using HTML and Javascript and saving the score using Ajax and SQL and reading the score back using Ajax and SQL.
    However, due to the time constraints of the project I was unable to get a working score system.
    <br>
    Since completing the project at university I have decided to revisit it from a different approach. As I have mentioned previously, since graduating I started working on my own games using unity. While working with a scoring system for a different game, I realised it would also work with this game.

  </p>

  <h5>Turning the website into a game using unity.</h5>
  <p>
    As I had all the assets needed to create the game already, it was very simple to create a small test of how the game would work coded in unity. 
    As of writing this, I have created three levels from the animal game featured on the site. It was very simple to implement it into unity and I will continue working on the game until it is complete.

        <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>
      As I want to pursue a career in game development, after graduating in the first half of 2020, I started creating my own game/games. 
      The first game I created was Asteroid Void. 
      My original plan for the game looks very different from the current version of the game.
    </p>

    <h3>First Version</h3>
    <p>
      The first version of the game included a black backdrop with rectangles of various colours acting as objects the player had to avoid. 
      The rectangles could also move to make it harder for the player. 
      The more and more I worked on the game the more I disliked it. 
      I was unsure what needed changing so I asked some friends for some feedback on what to improve. 
      One of them said the game looked lifeless and I agreed. The games lighting looked didn’t look correct against the black background. 
      Using rectangles as obstacles also seemed incorrect considering the game is about controlling a space rocket. 
      The game also ad large yellow rectangles surrounding the game’s border. This made the game feel very small.
    </p>
    <img src="originalGame.jpg" alt="HTML5 Icon" id="gameImg">

    <h3>Current version</h3>
    <p>
      The version I’m currently developing looks very different compared to the previous version. 
      The background is now no longer a solid colour, but rather a collection of 3D models placed together to make the game seem like it’s in outer space. 
      I also removed the rectangles which were surrounding the border to make the game look bigger. 
      Instead of rectangles acting like obstacles for the player to avoid, I modelled some asteroids in blender to fit with the game’s “space” look. Unlike the previous version, I have also added enemies to the game. These can be seen further down the page.

    <h3>Main Menu</h3>
    <p>From here the player is able to play the game from the first level by clicking on the (Play) option. 
      When the player clicks on the (level select) option they are able to select 4 different difficulty settings each with their own unique set of levels. 
      In the current build of the game, I have only created levels for the first two difficulties. 
      When the player accesses a difficulty setting, they are able to see a score for each of the levels they have completed in the form of stars. 
      The stars also update if they improve their score.

    </p>
    <img src="mainMenu.PNG" alt="HTML5 Icon" id="gameImg">

    <h3>Playing a level</h3>
    <p>
      The aim of the game is to move the rocket from one side of the screen to the other while avoiding objects and collecting stars. 
      Once the user completes a level within the game, they are given the option to continue playing, or to go back to the game’s main menu. 
      If the player plays the game on a PC they can use the arrow keys or w,a,s,d, keys to move the rocket. 
      On a mobile device UI buttons appear on screen to allow players to play the game on a mobile device. 

    </p>

    <h3>Enemies</h3>
    <p>
      Throughout the game, there are various enemies the player can come across. 
    </p>
    <h4>HIVE</h4>
    <p>
      The hive is a circular shaped enemy which rotates and shoots out smaller versions of itself to attack the player. 
      When the player comes in contact with this enemy, they lose 1 heart of health.
    </p>
    <img src="Hive.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" id="gameImg">
    <h4>TADPOD</h4>
    <p>
      Very small rocket which is shaped like a tadpole. 
      It fires small streams of bullets towards the player which removes 1 heart of health.
    </p>
    <img src="TADPOD.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" id="gameImg">

    <h4>Items/power-ups</h4>
    <p>
      All assets visible in the game were created by me using blender. The game is written in Unity C#.
      The game uses touch controls but also a keyboard and mouse which allows the game to be played on a mobile device or a computer.

    <h1>LImBuS Biobank Information Management System</h1>
    <p>During July-August 2021 I had the opportunity to work on LImBuS Biobank Information Management System. 
      I worked on various parts of the website while working there. The main structure of the website is built
      off of a Python framework called Flask. Before working on the system, I had never used Flask before. 
      While reading through the code I picked up an understanding on the code. I worked using a variety of 
      languages while there. These included Python, JavaScript, HTML and some SQL. 
      <br>
      <br>
      For the first few weeks I was mostly working on improving the interface. This included changing what
      information was displayed on the site. This required changing code in a JavaScript file and some HTML.
      I then moved on something slightly more complicated which was changing how a table was displayed. This
      required me to have some knowledge of a variety of languages e.g. Python, JavaScript, HTML and SQL. This
      was difficult as the system is fairly large and complex and it required work on both the front-end and the
      back-end of the site. It also included connecting various parts of the site to each other through Python files.
      I needed to display the shelf that was associated to the rack and also include a link to the shelf itself.
      <br>
      <br>
      For the final week it was discussed with a colleague that if a user were to sign-up to the site, that they
      should be sent a confirmation email when they signed-up to the site. This was challenging as it required
      a flask-extension to be installed which was Flask-Mail. This required installing the extension using a terminal.
      I wasn't too familar using a terminal to manage files therefore it was a bit challenging. I managed to get the
      extension to install with the assistance of a colleague which I was happy with. Once the extension was installed
      I continued working on implementing the extension for the remainder of the week while I was there.</p>
