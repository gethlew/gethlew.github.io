  3D Advent Calendar
  <br>
  <br>
  During the latter half of 2020 I decided that I wanted to improve my 3D modelling skills, therefore I decided to create a new 3D model each day up until Christmas. 
  Throughout the three weeks it took for me to complete the models, I gained many skills which will help me throughout my 3D modelling journey. 
  To see other 3D models I created please click on the “3D Models” tab above.

<p id ="day1">
  Day 7
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="3D Advent/Day 7.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" id="advDay">
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Today the model built is based off the image on the right which is a Angel.
  <br>
  <br>
  I decided to also model the top of a Christmas tree to add more dimension to the scene.
</p>

<p id ="day2">
  Day 8
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="3D Advent/Day 8.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" id="advDay">
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Today the model built is based off the image on the right which is a Teddy bear
  <br>
  <br>
  For this model I tried my hand at sculpting within blender. I was very difficult but I think the model came out decent.

</p>

<p id ="day3">
  Day 9
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="3D Advent/Day 9.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" id="advDay">
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Today the model built is based off the image on the right which is a Cornet.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is by far the most complex model I've done to date but I think it came out good. I also added the baubles and bow seen in the right image.

</p>

<p id ="day4">
  Day 10
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="3D Advent/Day 10.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" id="advDay">
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The model today is based off the image on the right which is a snowflake.
  <br>
  <br>
  This one was surprisingly difficult but I think it looks decent.
</p>

<p id ="day5">
  Day 11
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="3D Advent/Day 11.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" id="advDay">
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The model built is based off the image on the right which is a Toy Boat
  <br>
  <br>
  The model was fairly simple so I decided to place it within an environment which is the botton of a Christmas tree.

  

</p>

<p id ="day6">
  Day 12
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="3D Advent/Day 12.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" id="advDay">
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Today the model built is based off the image on the right which is a pair of Ice Skates.
  <br>
  <br>
  This one confused me as I was unsure if they were roller skates or ice skates. 

  <br>
  <br>
  As i thought they were skates, I created a wintery scene to include them in.
  <br>
  <br>
  I gave the ground below the skates a reflective look to mimic the look of a frozen lake.
