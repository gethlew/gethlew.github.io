          <br>
          This was a fairly simple model to create. My technique was starting off with a 
          cilynder and adding various loop cuts to it. Once completed I moved the top half of
          the cilynder around using the spin tool in edit mode. I created the bow by modifying a cube in edit mode.

          Today the model built is based off the image on the right which is a snowmans head. The image only includes a snowman head but I decided to model an entire snowman as a added challenge.
          <br>
          <br>
          This model was fairly simple to create as i mostly used only primitive shapes. The snowman's body and head consisted of mostly un-changed spheres. 
          I created the snowman's scarf by starting off with a sphere, removing a portion of mesh from the top and half from the botton. The hat is made up of two cilynders of different sizes. The bow of the hat is indentical to that used for the candy cane.

          Today the model built is based off the image on the right which is a candle. I tried a different technique to get the candle to glow.
          <br>
          <br>
          To create the glowing effect of the candle. I added a glossy material to a sphere and changed it's transparency.

          Today the model built is based off the image on the right which is a Christmas present
          <br>
          <br>
          Decided to create multiple presents to give the scene more dimension.
          This was the simplest model to create as each present was exactly the same.
          A presents starts off as a cube with many loop cuts through out. I selected the parts of the loop cuts that I wanted to
          use for the ribbon. I extruded these parts outwards to create the look of a ribbon. The bow used on top of the presents is the same 
          bow used for the previous models.

          This was by far the hardest to model yet. I couldn't quite get the arms to look the way I wanted and the eyes are a bit off.

          <br>
          <br>
          This one was a complex model to create. 
          The legs of the horse were very basic modified cubes, and the roller board beneath the horse was created using a combination of cylinders.
          The saddle of the horse is my favourite part of this model. I feel it looks very good an the technique is interessting. The saddle is a cylinder which is scaled across two axis. I then removed parts of the cilynder to create the saddle shape.

          <br>
          <br>
          This is one of my favourite 3D models as it was simple to create, but also looks really good. I think the reason it stands out to me so much is the material used.
          The material makes the model look metalic. The placement of the bell on a tree also makes the model look very good as it helps visualize the model as something that could be seen in the real world.

          <br>
          This was a difficult model to get the details right. Im happy with the shape of the model but the details look a bit rough. I have included a combination of two different models in this, the current model
          (GingerbreadWoman and another model which was created in day 6). I think the scenery improves the overall look of the model.

          Today the model built is based off the image on the right which is a Gingerbread Man.
          <br>
          <br>
          Same as the gingerbread woman, this was a difficult model to get the details right. Im happy with the shape of the model but the details look a bit rough. I have included a combination of three different models in this, the current model
          (Gingerbreadman) and the previous two models (GingerbreadWoman) and (gingerbread house). I think the scenery improves the overall look of the model.

          Today the model built is based off the image on the right which is a toy train.
          <br>
          <br>
          This is one of my favourite models which I have created as it was fairly simple to make and it looks really good in my opinion.
          The models is built using only primitive shapes with the exception of the front wheel guard.

          The model today is based off the image on the right which is a bauble.
          <br>
          <br>
          This was a fairly simple model to create. The body of the bauble is a modified sphere. The details were very simple to create as I used a
          asterix (*) text element to create the details along the edge of the bauble.

          The model built is based off the image on the right which is a drum
          <br>
          <br>
          This was probably the hardest model to create as the details were very tricky to replicate. The technique i used to create the details
          around the edge of the drum wasn't very effective.

          Today is my final entry to my 3D Advent calendar . The image is of Santa Claus's head.
          <br>
          <br>
          I started this Advent Calendar as I wanted to improve my 3D modelling skills and I think I have succeeded. I will no longer post 3D models on this account as I have created a new one specially for 3D modelling.
