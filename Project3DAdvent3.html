  3D Advent Calendar
  <br>
  <br>
  During the latter half of 2020 I decided that I wanted to improve my 3D modelling skills, therefore I decided to create a new 3D model each day up until Christmas. 
  Throughout the three weeks it took for me to complete the models, I gained many skills which will help me throughout my 3D modelling journey. 
  To see other 3D models I created please click on the “3D Models” tab above.

  Day 13
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="3D Advent/Day 13.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" id="advDay">
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Today the model built is based off the image on the right which is a Mitten/Glove.
  <br>
  <br>
  This model was surprisingly difficult as I had to make the model look like fabric. 
  <br>
  <br>
  On my first attempt the model looked like plastic and too "perfect". I then decided to sculpt parts of the model to give it a more natural look. I also added hair physics to simulate fabric fibre.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Today the model built is based off the image on the right which is a letter box.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the scene, I decided to duplcate the cubes and rotate them and place them under the bottom of a tree to create a chritmas-like environmnet.

  Day 15
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="3D Advent/Day 15.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" id="advDay">
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The model today is based off the image on the right which is a wooden horse.
  <br>
  <br>
  This one was a complex model to create. 
  The legs of the horse were very basic modified cubes, and the roller board beneath the horse was created using a combination of cylinders.
  The saddle of the horse is my favourite part of this model. I feel it looks very good an the technique is interessting. The saddle is a cylinder which is scaled across two axis. I then removed parts of the cilynder to create the saddle shape.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The model built is based off the image on the right which is a bell.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is one of my favourite 3D models as it was simple to create, but also looks really good. I think the reason it stands out to me so much is the material used.
  The material makes the model look metalic. The placement of the bell on a tree also makes the model look very good as it helps visualize the model as something that could be seen in the real world.

  Day 18
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="3D Advent/Day 18.png" alt="GingerbreadWoman" id="advDay">
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Today the model built is based off the image on the right which is a Gingerbread woman.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was a difficult model to get the details right. Im happy with the shape of the model but the details look a bit rough. I have included a combination of two different models in this, the current model
  (GingerbreadWoman and another model which was created in day 6). I think the scenery improves the overall look of the model.
