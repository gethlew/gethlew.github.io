  <article id="about" class="about justify-content-center">
    This portfolio is designed with the intention allowing me to show all of the various projects
    related to game development/VR development that I have worked over the my career .
    <br>
    <br>
    I worked as a Web Developer for a few years working as part of a team on various projects.
    Many of the skills I gained/learned as a Web Developer have been useful and transferable when 
    working on my own projects.
    <br>
    <br>
    After I finished working as a Web Developer, I continued working on my personal Game Development projects.
    This portfolio showcases the projects/games I've worked on over the past few years and that I continue to work on currently.
    Some of the projecs include a link to play the game itself, where others have descriptions on the progress I have made.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you have any questions or would like more information on any of the projects I've worked on, feel free to
    contact me through the "Contact" tab above.
