  Profesional profile
  <br>
  <br>
  I have used many different programming languages in my time at university and in my free time. 
  Of all the programming languages I have used I am most comfortable using C#, HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. 
  Using the previously mentioned programming languages, I completed a final year project at university which was creating a web-based game for young children to learn Welsh. 
  I have also continued working on the game after university and Iâ€™m hoping to turn the game into an application in the near future. 
  As a person I am very passionate about virtual reality and its possible uses in the future. I am also currently creating my own games in Unity using C#.
