  <article id="about">
    This portfolio is designed with the intention allowing me to show all of the various projects
    I have worked on during my time at University and after.
    <br>
    <br>
    The projects are a mix of Web Development, Game Development and 3D modelling. 
    <br>
    <br>
    For Web Development I've mostly worked in HTML,
    JavaScript, CSS and most recently Python. I have also been learning React for a few months but I have yet to create a project using it.
    For Game Development I've mostly been coding in C# but I have recently started learning C++ also.
    To create the assets/art used in my games I've been using the following software. I've been using Blender for creating 3D objects,
    Procreate and Microsoft apps to create the 2D objects e.g. UI and images and apple garage band to create the sounds used in my games.
