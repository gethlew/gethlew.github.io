  Sploder, a user's guide
  <br>
  <br>
  During my first year at University I created a website using WordPress.
  The website was centred around how to use a website called Sploder. 
  Sploder is a website which allows users to create their own games within the website itself. 
  I was in charge of creating the website and amending the various sections of the site when needed. 
  Each member of the group were given their own section within the site to work on. 
  I was in charge of writing the “Sploder’s use in education” section. 
  Throughout the project I was given the role of ensuring all sections of the site were free from 
  spelling mistakes and that the content of the page was correct. The site is still functioning to this day and 
  can be viewed here.
