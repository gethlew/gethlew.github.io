  3D Advent Calendar
  <br>
  <br>
  During the latter half of 2020 I decided that I wanted to improve my 3D modelling skills, therefore I decided to create a new 3D model each day up until Christmas. 
  Throughout the three weeks it took for me to complete the models, I gained many skills which will help me throughout my 3D modelling journey. 
  To see other 3D models I created please click on the “3D Models” tab above.

  Day 19
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="3D Advent/Day 19.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" id="advDay">
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Today the model built is based off the image on the right which is a Chritsmas Star.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shape of the star was fairly simple to create but i'm not very happy with how the details turned out. I don't think this
  3D model translates well from a 2D object.

  Day 20
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="3D Advent/Day 20.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" id="advDay">
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Today the model built is based off the image on the right which is a Gingerbread Man.
  <br>
  <br>
  Same as the gingerbread woman, this was a difficult model to get the details right. Im happy with the shape of the model but the details look a bit rough. I have included a combination of three different models in this, the current model
  (Gingerbreadman) and the previous two models (GingerbreadWoman) and (gingerbread house). I think the scenery improves the overall look of the model.

  Day 21
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="3D Advent/Day 21.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" id="advDay">
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Today the model built is based off the image on the right which is a toy train.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is one of my favourite models which I have created as it was fairly simple to make and it looks really good in my opinion.
  The models is built using only primitive shapes with the exception of the front wheel guard.

  Day 22
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="3D Advent/Day 22.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" id="advDay">
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The model today is based off the image on the right which is a bauble.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was a fairly simple model to create. The body of the bauble is a modified sphere. The details were very simple to create as I used a
  asterix (*) text element to create the details along the edge of the bauble.

  Day 23
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="3D Advent/Day 23.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" id="advDay">
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The model built is based off the image on the right which is a drum
  <br>
  <br>
  This was probably the hardest model to create as the details were very tricky to replicate. The technique i used to create the details
  around the edge of the drum wasn't very effective.

  Today is my final entry to my 3D Advent calendar . The image is of Santa Claus's head.
 <br>
 <br>
I started this Advent Calendar as I wanted to improve my 3D modelling skills and I think I have succeeded. I will no longer post 3D models on this account as I have created a new one specially for 3D modelling.
