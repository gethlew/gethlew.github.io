  Project SPD / Asteroid Void
  <br>
  <br>
  As I want to pursue a career in game development, after graduating in the first half of 2020, I started creating my own game/games. 
  Screenshots of the game can be shown on the right.
  The aim of the game is to move the rocket from one side of the screen to the other. 
  The game uses touch controls but also a keyboard and mouse which allows the game to be played on a mobile device or a computer. 
  All assets visible in the game were created by me using blender. The game is written in C#.

  Today the model built is based off the image on the right which is a Angel.
  <br>
  I also modeled the top of a Christmas tree.

  <br>
  Today the model built is based off the image on the right which is a Teddy bear
  <br>
  <br>
  For this model I tried my hand at sculpting within blender. I was very difficult but I think the model came out decent.

  <img src="3D Advent/Day 21.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" width=50% height=50% style="">

  <br>
  <br>
  Today the model built is based off the image on the right which is a Cornet.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is by far the most complex model I've done to date but I think it came out good. I also added the baubles and bow seen in the right image.

  The model today is based off the image on the right which is a snowflake.
  <br>
  <br>
  This one was surprisingly difficult but I think it looks decent.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The model built is based off the image on the right which is a Toy Boat
  <br>
  <br>
  The model was fairly simple so I decided to place it within an environment which is the botton of a Christmas tree.
