  3D Advent Calendar
  <br>
  <br>
  During the latter half of 2020 I decided that I wanted to improve my 3D modelling skills, therefore I decided to create a new 3D model each day up until Christmas. 
  Throughout the three weeks it took for me to complete the models, I gained many skills which will help me throughout my 3D modelling journey. 
  To see other 3D models I created please click on the “3D Models” tab above.

  <br>
  <img src="3D Advent/Day 1.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" id="advDay">
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  This was a fairly simple model to create. My technique was starting off with a 
  cilynder and adding various loop cuts to it. Once completed I moved the top half of
  the cilynder around using the spin tool in edit mode. I created the bow by modifying a cube in edit mode.

  Today the model built is based off the image on the right which is a snowmans head. The image only includes a snowman head but I decided to model an entire snowman as a added challenge.
  <br>
  <br>
  This model was fairly simple to create as i mostly used only primitive shapes. The snowman's body and head consisted of mostly un-changed spheres. 
  I created the snowman's scarf by starting off with a sphere, removing a portion of mesh from the top and half from the botton. The hat is made up of two cilynders of different sizes. The bow of the hat is indentical to that used for the candy cane.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Today the model built is based off the image on the right which is a candle. I tried a different technique to get the candle to glow.
  <br>
  <br>
  To create the glowing effect of the candle. I added a glossy material to a sphere and changed it's transparency.

  Day 4

  <br>
  <img src="3D Advent/Day 4.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" id="advDay">
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Today the model built is based off the image on the right which is a Christmas present
  <br>
  <br>
  Decided to create multiple presents to give the scene more dimension.
  This was the simplest model to create as each present was exactly the same.
  A presents starts off as a cube with many loop cuts through out. I selected the parts of the loop cuts that I wanted to
  use for the ribbon. I extruded these parts outwards to create the look of a ribbon. The bow used on top of the presents is the same 
  bow used for the previous models.

  <img src="3D Advent/Day 5.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" id="advDay">
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Today the model built is based off the image on the right which is a toy soldier.
  <br>
  <br>
This was by far the hardest to model yet. I couldn't quite get the arms to look the way I wanted and the eyes are a bit off.

  Day 6
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="3D Advent/Day 6.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" id="advDay">
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Today the model built is based off the image on the right which is a Gingerbread house.
  <br>
  <br>
  I had alot of fun making this one, I also tried to create a bit of scenery using snow.
